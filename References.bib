abstract="Agent based models (ABMs) simulate actions and interactions of autonomous agents/groups and their effect on systems as a whole, accounting for learning without assuming perfect rationality or complete knowledge. ABMs are an increasingly popular approach to studying complex, spatially distributed socio-environmental systems, but have still to become an established approach in the sense of being one that is expected by those wanting to explore scenarios in such systems. Partly, this is an issue of awareness -- ABM is still new enough that many people have not heard of it; partly, it is an issue of confidence -- ABM has more to do to prove itself if it is to become a preferred method. This paper will identify advances in the craft and deployment of ABM needed if ABM is to become an accepted part of mainstream science for policy or stakeholders. The conduct of ABM has, over the last decade, seen a transition from using abstracted representations of systems (supporting theory-led thought experiments) to more accessible representations derived empirically (to deliver more applied analysis). This has enhanced the perception of potential users of ABM outputs that the latter are salient and credible. Empirical ABM is not, however, a panacea, as it demands more computing and data resources, limiting applications to domains where data exist along with suitable environmental models where these are required. Further, empirical ABM is still facing serious questions of validation and the ontology used to describe the system in the first place. Using Geoffrey A. Moore's Crossing the Chasm as a lens, we argue that the way ahead for ABM lies in identifying the niches in which it can best demonstrate its advantages, working with collaborators to demonstrate that it can deliver on its promises. This leads us to identify several areas where work is needed.",

  abstract={When is record-keeping better arranged through a blockchain than through a traditional centralized intermediary? The ideal qualities of any record-keeping system are (i) correctness, (ii) decentralization, and (iii) cost efficiency. We point out a blockchain trilemma: no ledger can satisfy all three properties simultaneously. A centralized record-keeper extracts rents due to its monopoly on the ledger. Its franchise value dynamically incentivizes correct reporting. Blockchains drive down rents by allowing for free entry of record-keepers and portability of information to competing “forks.” Blockchains must, therefore, provide static incentives for correctness through computationally expensive proof-of-work algorithms and permit record-keepers to roll back history in order to undo fraudulent reports. While blockchains can keep track of ownership transfers, enforcement of possession rights is often better complemented by centralized record-keeping.},

We model the proof-of-work blockchain protocol as a stochastic game and analyze the equilibrium strategies of rational, strategic miners. Mining the longest chain is a Markov perfect equilibrium, without forking, in line with Nakamoto (2008). The blockchain protocol, however, is a coordination game, with multiple equilibria. There exist equilibria with forks, leading to orphaned blocks and persistent divergence between chains. We also show how forks can be generated by information delays and software upgrades. Last we identify negative externalities implying that equilibrium investment in computing capacity is excessive.Received May 31, 2017; editorial decision July 6, 2018 by Editor Itay Goldstein.}",

Blockchain has numerous application scenarios and huge development potential, Bitcoin is the most representative one of it. Primarily, the first generation blockchain and the second generation blockchain and their respective representative crypto-currencies: Bitcoin and Ether are introduced briefly. Next, a new type of blockchain based on DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) structure is illustrated, it is considered to be the possible evolution route of the next generation blockchain. Furthermore, two influential applications of DAG blockchain systems: IOTA and Byteball are introduced. Finally, Conclusion and forecast of blockchain are discussed.",

	abstract = {Multi-part DNA assembly is the physical starting point for many projects in Synthetic and Molecular Biology. The ability to explore a genetic design space by building extensive libraries of DNA constructs is essential for creating programmed biological systems that perform the desired functions. With multiple DNA assembly methods and standards adopted in the Synthetic Biology community, automation of the DNA assembly process has received serious attention in recent years. Importantly, automating DNA assembly enables larger builds using less researcher time, increasing the accessible design space. However, these benefits currently incur high costs for both equipment and consumables. Here, we address this limitation by introducing low-cost DNA assembly with BASIC on OpenTrons (DNA-BOT). For this purpose, we developed an open-source software package dnabot (https://github.com/BASIC-DNA-ASSEMBLY/dnabot). We demonstrate the performance of DNA-BOT by simultaneously assembling 88 constructs composed of 10 genetic parts, exploring the promoter, ribosome binding site (RBS) and gene order design space for a 3-gene operon. All 88 constructs were assembled with high accuracy, at a cost of $1.50 - $5.50 per construct. This illustrates the efficiency, accuracy and affordability of DNA-BOT making it accessible for most labs and democratising automated DNA assembly.},
